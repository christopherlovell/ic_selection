# ic_selection
Select regions for zoom-ICs. Requires a density grid generated with [DensityGridder](https://github.com/christopherlovell/densitygridder)

## Files

- `sim_test.py` -> an example simulation file. Contains a class detailing the simulation. Copy and edit this for each simulation.

- `convolve.py` loads the specified gridded density field, and smoothes with a top-hat convolution window (specified in the simulation file). Called as follows:

`python convolve.py sim_test grid_weights/example_grid_file.dat output/example_output_file.dat`

- `fit.py` fits the overdensity distribution (and plots it). Must specify simulation file as argument.

- `select_regions.py` provides methods for selecting based on overdensity and distance from the mean. It first selects the 15 highest overdensities, so that the subsequent ones donâ€™t overlap with it. Accepts the required sigma of the region as an argument (after the specified simulation file) and displays a subset of the selected coordinates.

- `methods.py` contains methods for exporting files, as well as the `simulation` class containing information on the source simulation boxsize, the grid size, and the smoothing window. All changes to these parameters should be made here to ensure consistency across scripts.

- `weights_grid.py` use this for generating the weights of the resim regions 

## Instructions
Run the following scripts in the following order:
```
python convolve.py
python fit.py
python select_regions.py
```
